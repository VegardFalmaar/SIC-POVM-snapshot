\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Parallelize starting vectors, MPI
\item A proper system for keeping track of results.
\item Review the handling of data/variables between the functions in {\ttfamily gradient\+\_\+descent}. (Related to the above point.)
\item Stop generating a new array of indices to shuffle every time a new vector is generated? Can shuffle in-\/place instead.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Save loss, fiducial, time to file
\item Parallelize starting vectors instead of loss, Open\+MP
\item Better generation of start vectors
\item (Failed, gone back) Try {\ttfamily long double} for higher precision
\item Precompute all d(d+1)/2 distinct values of G-\/matrix in analytic gradient function. Use a class such the same array may be used throughout the minimization of one vector?
\item Simplify the loop over vector batches, better to loop seed by seed.
