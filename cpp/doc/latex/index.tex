This in an implementation of various algorithms to find S\+I\+C-\/\+P\+O\+V\+Ms in complex vector spaces of arbitrary dimensions.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Structure}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
The code is organized in three directories\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily main/}\+: logic specific to each algorithm employed, each file contains a {\ttfamily main} function
\item {\ttfamily src/}\+: logic and data structures shared by all algorithms
\item {\ttfamily test/}\+: tests of the code in the {\ttfamily src} directory 
\end{DoxyItemize}
