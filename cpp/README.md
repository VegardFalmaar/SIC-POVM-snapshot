Numerical search for SIC-POVMs
========
This in an implementation of various algorithms to find SIC-POVMs in complex
vector spaces of arbitrary dimensions.

Structure
--------
The code is organized in three directories:
- `main/`: logic specific to each algorithm employed, each file contains a
`main` function
- `src/`: logic and data structures shared by all algorithms
- `test/`: tests of the code in the `src` directory
