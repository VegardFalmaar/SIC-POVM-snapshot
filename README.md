# SIC-POVM-snapshot

A snapshot of the code from my Masterâ€™s thesis on the numerical search for
SIC-POVMs.

Includes OpenMP-parallelized C++ code implementing a gradient based ap-
proach for local minimization which has been used to find SIC-POVMs in pa-
rameter spaces above dimensionality 80.

Also includes implementations in Python of gradient based optimization, global
optimizers like Differential Evolution and SHGO, and combinations of these.
